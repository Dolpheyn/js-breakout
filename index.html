	<p>This is a game inspired by a retro atari game "breakout".</p>
	<p>
	It has 6 levels with different blocks positions and ball speed. 
	You control a paddle to bounce the ball upwards. You lose by getting
	the ball fall below the paddle and you win by completing all the 6 
	levels. Goodluck and have fun!
